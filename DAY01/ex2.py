# A comment, this is so you can read your program later
#Anything after the # is a comment and ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this") # and the comment after is ignored

# you can also use comment to "disable" or comment out code:
#print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.
